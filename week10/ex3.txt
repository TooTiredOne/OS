At the very beginning: -rw-r--r--
After removing execute permission: -rw-r--r-- 
(not much changed, heh)
After granting all permissions to owner and others (not group): -rwxr--rwx
After making group permissions equal to user permissions: -rwxrwxrwx

660: owner's permissions: rw, group's permissions: rw, others have no permissions

777: everyone's permissions: rwx
