the file input2_incr.txt contains a sequence that will increase the hit/miss ratio.
it does so, as we have only 1 page. So, we'll have only 1 miss at the very beginning when the page table is empty.

For the size of 10: hit/miss == 564/1

For the size of 50: hit/miss == 564/1

For the size of 100: hit/miss == 564/1




the file input2_decr.txt contains a sequence that will decrease the hit/miss ratio. No number repeats in this sequence. So, we will never have a hit.

For the size of 10: hit/miss == 0/50

For the size of 50: hit/miss == 0/50

For the size of 100: hit/miss == 0/50
